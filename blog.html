I fall into the second category. This time around, deviating from the established protocol, Athul, Arjun and myself decided to make a trip on Christmas day. The main reason for this divergence from the usual custom is that like myself, they too didn't have any plans for that day. A number of places came up during our discussion. Since a one-day trip was planned, we limited the radius of our search to a bare 100Km. It was then that Athul suggested(Indulekha Ad üòÇ) Marunthuvazh Malai as the destination. For all those who don't know much about this place, Marunthuvazh Malai also known as "the abode of medicinal herbs" is located in Kanyakumari district, close to the south tip of India. As per tradition, a fragment of the Sanjeevani mountain fell down while Lord Hanuman was carrying it‚Ä¶</p>

Isfield falls, located at the base of the hill, is another destination to visit along the route to Ambanad estate. The waterfall can be reached by taking a deviation away from the main road and traveling close to 1 Km along a forest trail. The trail cannot even be remotely considered as a motorable road. The path is untarred and filled with rocks and pebbles of varying sizes. Along with that, the treacherous uphill section at the end of the trail makes the ride precarious. For those traveling to the place, I highly recommend parking your vehicle, regardless of whether it is a car or bike, near the main road and then trek to the waterfall. Athul, who always had a propensity for off-roading started ahead and I followed behind. The waterfall is situated at the end of the trail. The weather was sw‚Ä¶</p>

A particular person(Yes it is you Vignesh!! üòõ) has even gone as far as to credit me with a new nickname. While all these accusations are false, this particular post will be focussed more on the location rather than the people present during the journey. And finally, a big sorry to Tuttu, who was expecting this post to be about the trip to Gokarna and was waiting to read about Thomas's Achilles Heel.The plan to ride to Ambanad hills was made on short notice. Athul, who had now become an expert in tracing out off-road routes, suggested the place via WhatsApp (Trust me, we are yet to find out how he is managing to sniff out such places).</p>

This time we decided to keep the journey short, the sole reason being the addition of a new RE Himalayan to our group. Unless you were stuck at the bottom of a cave or stranded at the top of Mt. Everest, you probably might have heard that Athul had purchased the so-called 'bike of his dreams'. Everyone was excited, as he had bragged our heads off for the past one and a half year on all the features and problems of the motorcycle. Now for the place. You see, the round trip distance to the destination should not exceed 200 Kilometers so that the Himalayan doesn't exceed its due kilometers for the first service.

The weekend ride to Rosemala was one such trip. Before I go into the nitty-gritty details,  I would like to give some background info on why I had decided to take this trip. I had bought a new bike a couple months back and was raring to go for a long ride. People who knew me perfectly well will say that the idea of me riding a bike for long distance is a like a disaster waiting to happen (Disclaimer: ee line Jojiye udeshichu alla). Arjun and Athul were a bit skeptical when I presented this idea, but after some nagging and persuading, both of them relented. For those who have already visited Rosemala, please feel free to skip to the next paragraph as I divulge on some details on Rosemala. Rosemala is part of Kollam District and is about 15 km away from Aryankavu junction, located along the National Highway connecting Thenmala with Pollachi. One can only r‚Ä¶</p>

Bonacaud, situated about 60 kilometers away from Trivandrum, the state capital of Kerala. Bonacaud is spread over an area of 2500 acres of valleys, waterfalls, and hills. In the past, it was known for its magnificent tea plantations started by the British. There were plenty of rumors flying around that there really is a haunted bungalow there. Immediately we searched Google and found many articles and even a news channel documentary on a bungalow situated there known for paranormal activities. The bungalow was built by a British couple. The legend is that the children of landowner died mysteriously, and the couple left the mansion to live the rest of their lives in London. People swear that they have seen lights flickering inside that house, strange voices and crying of children too. There was no hesitation from any of us. We agreed to go there the following Saturday.
